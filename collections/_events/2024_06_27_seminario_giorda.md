description: "The predictive nature of mathematical and computational models has been enhancing the process of understanding numerous physiopathological dynamics and designing therapeutic devices. In silico models are today not only a major tool (alongside in vivo and in vitro experiments) of basic research, they are becoming part of the medical routine in clinical trials and therapy planning as well. Clinicians benefit from effective and reliable non-invasive, patient-specific, instruments to improve diagnosis and prognosis. In return, computational models can provide rigorous tools for quantitative analyses, and patient specific simulations are made possible by integrating such models with individual data and medical images. Still, biomedical problems are extremely complex and require a combined effort from mathematicians, biomedical engineers and medical doctors.
In this talk I will present some recent developments in the field of endocardiac ablation treatment of arrhythmias and extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation developed in collaboration with the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau in Barcelona, and the Kepler University Klinikum in Linz."
