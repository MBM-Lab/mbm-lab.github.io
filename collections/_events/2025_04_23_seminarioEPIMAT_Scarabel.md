description: "I will discuss some recent analyses of infectious disease models with waning of immunity and waning-boosting of immunity, when the disease parameters depend on time since infection. The analyses show emergence of oscillations for particular shapes of the disease parameters, and the existence of regions of parameters where a stable endemic equilibrium coexists with a stable periodic solution, or two stable periodic solutions coexist."
