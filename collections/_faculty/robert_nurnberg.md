cv: In 2003 I received a PhD in Numerical Analysis from Imperial College London. After my PhD I worked first as a Lecturer and then as a Senior Lecturer at Imperial College, before moving to Trento in 2020 as an Associate Professor in Numerical Analysis. 
research_interests: My main fields of interest are Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computing. In particular, my research often focuses on variational numerical methods for moving interface problems that can arise in Materials Science, Crystal Growth, Fluid Mechanics, Engineering, Biomathematics or Differential Geometry. Example applications in Biomathematics I worked on in the past include diffuse interface models for tumour growth and sharp interface appromixations of simplified models for biomembranes and vesicles.
