cv: "Simone Pezzuto is assistant professor in numerical analysis at university of Trento and an external collaborator the Euler Institute of Università della Svizzera italiana, Lugano. He received his PhD in 2013 from Politecnico di Milano (MOX, Department of Mathematics). Until September 2022, he was Group Leader at the Center for Computational Medicine in Cardiology, Università della Svizzera italiana (Lugano). Previously, he was a postdoctoral researcher at Simula Research Laboratory, Norway and visiting student at CMRG at UCSD."
research_interests: "<p>Simone Pezzuto's research lies at the intersection of applied mathematics and cardiac modelling, with a focus on developing novel numerical methods for efficient solutions of complex cardiac models and the creation of digital twins. His work leverages PDE-constrained optimization, scientific machine learning, uncertainty quantification, and Bayesian optimization. In collaboration with clinicians and physiologists, he applies these methodologies to clinically relevant challenges, including atrial fibrillation and cardiac resynchronization therapy.</p>

<p>Simone Pezzuto has an extensive network of collaborations in Europe and worldwide. He is a team leader in the <a href='https://microcard.eu/index-en.html' target='_blank'>MICROCARD project</a>, a board member of the <a href='https://personalizeaf.net' target='_blank'>PersonalizeAF network</a>, and scientific collaborator in several research projects.</p>"
