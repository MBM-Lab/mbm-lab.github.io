description: "In Portugal, where West Nile virus (WNV) infects equines every year, little to nothing is known about its epidemic dynamics and/or endemicity. To date, based on serology alone and no viral isolation, only 4 human cases have been reported. This is at odds with the Spanish reality just across the border, where WNV has recently been causing frequent outbreaks among humans, equines and birds. Over the past 4 years our group has been looking into mapping the ecological suitability of WNV in Portuguese territory. On this seminar I will summarize recent and ongoing work related to this topic, which has now developed into work in other territories."
