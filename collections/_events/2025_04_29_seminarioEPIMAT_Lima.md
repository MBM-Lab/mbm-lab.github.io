description: "In this talk, I will present some epidemiological case studies, including several models built to describe the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic situation in Brazil, considering the Gamma, Delta and Omicron variants and the vaccination status. For all models, I will present simulations according to the epidemiological situation analysed and their implications for the behaviour of the pandemic."
