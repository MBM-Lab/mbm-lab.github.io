description: "The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is a competent vector of arboviruses, such as dengue. After its introduction into southern Europe, this invasive species has been rapidly spreading as well as causing autochthonous cases of arboviral diseases. Both Ae. albopictus presence and potential to transmit arboviruses are facilitated at warm temperatures, hence global warming is expected to favor their presence in temperate regions.
We use a climate- and environmental-driven mechanistic modelling framework to investigate the impact of recent climate change on Ae. albopictus range expansion and its potential to transmit dengue in Western Europe. We simulate climatic suitability, adult density and dengue transmission risk which we compare with a large ensemble of entomological and epidemiological observations over the past 20 years. Most importantly, we analyze a novel dataset about colonization of French municipalities to estimate the spread rate of Ae. albopictus and compare it with model predictions. Lastly, we analyze the sensitivity of entomological and epidemiological risk to changes in temperature, rainfall and human density.
Distribution of simulated mosquito populations and dengue transmission risk satisfactorily match entomological and dengue observations for Western Europe (AUC = 0.90 and 0.75 respectively). While lowlands in southern Europe were already climatically suitable for hosting Ae. albopictus around 2010, Western France, together with large populated cities such as London, Zagreb and Vienna, have only become suitable recently. Importantly, the accelerating colonization of Ae. albopictus in France may be approaching its theoretical climatic suitability limit; future expansion will depend on the climate-driven enlargement of suitable areas. Area at risk of local dengue transmission has recently expanded from the Mediterranean coasts over northern Spain and Western France. The sensitivity analysis suggests that climate change may expose medium-sized cities to the highest epidemiological risk; this finding is consistent with recently reported dengue outbreaks in Italy and France."
