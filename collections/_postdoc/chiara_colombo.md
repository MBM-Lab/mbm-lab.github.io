cv: "In March 2021 I graduated cum laude with a Master's Degree in applied mathematics at the university of Trento (Curriculum Mathematics and Statistics for Life and Data Sciences, track Modelling and Simulation for Biomedical Applications). Currently, I am a PhD candidate at the department of Civil, 
Environmental, and Mechanical Engineering of the university of Trento, working on the modeling and the simulation of the effects of the orthostatic stress on the human cardiovascular system.
At the same time, I also won a 1 year research fellowship at the department of Mathematics of the university of Trento, working on the coupling between 3D and 1D models of vascularized tissues."
research_interests: "My main research interests include the development of reduced order (1D and 0D) models for the blood flow dynamics of the human cardiovascular system to accurately represent the complex human cardiovascular physiology. I am also interested in the development of numerical analysis techniques necessary for the simulation of the represented problems, among which numerical methods for the solution of partial differential equations of hyperbolic type, with particular attention to well balance problems of the numerical approximations emerging from steady state situations. Recently, I am working on the development of coupling techniques of 1D blood flow models immersed into 3D models."
