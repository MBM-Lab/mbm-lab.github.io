cv: "In June 2015 I obtained a Master's Degree in Biotechnical systems and technologies at Ural Federal University (Yekaterinburg, Russia) in collaboration with the Institute of Immunology and Physiology, Russian Academy of Sciences. My research was focused on refining the mechano-electrical mathematical models of cardiomyocytes.
In 2015, I began my PhD in Biophysics at the Institute of Immunology and Physiology, Russian Academy of Sciences. My research was centered on understanding the mechanisms of cardiac electromechanics, particularly the cooperative interactions between contractile proteins in cardiomyocites.
Later, my work evolved to focus on developing cardiac digital twins to simulate individual cardiac electrophysiology and predict responses to interventions. As part of collaborative projects with international labs, I also investigated the effects of myocardial fibrosis on arrhythmogenesis, using supercomputer simulations to explore the structural and functional changes in the heart.
From November 2024, I hold a research fellowship at the University of Trento, with focusing on developing computationally efficient surrogate models of cardiac electrophysiology using deep learning methods."

research_interests: "My primary research interests lie in creating personalized cardiac digital twins for simulating and predicting responses to medical interventions, including surgeries and pharmacological treatments. I am also focused on modeling cardiomyopathies to understand disease progression and develop anti-arrhythmogenic therapies."
