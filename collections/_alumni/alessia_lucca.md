cv: "In March 2020 I obtained a Master's Degree in Mathematics at the University of Trento in the curriculum Mathematics and Statistics for Life and Social Sciences within the track Modeling and Simulation for Biomedical Applications. 
In June 2020 I won a postgraduate research activity scholarship for 3 months at the Department of Civil, Environmental and Mechanical Engineering of the University of Trento during which I worked on the mathematical and numerical analysis of non-stationary flows in human arterial vessels. From November 2020 I am the holder of a PhD scholarship in computational modeling with application to cardiovascular problems at the  Department of Mathematics of the University of Trento."
research_interests: "My main research interests regard
- Model and simulation of hemodynamics in coronary arteries through numerical calculation with particular emphasis on the study of pathological state of the cardiovascular system with the aim to predict non-invasively hemodynamic diagnostic indexes.
- Develop numerical methods to efficiently discretize mathematical models describing biofluidynamic problems. I focused on the discretization of  the Navier-Stokes equations both in complex networks of one-dimensional domains and in three-dimensional geometries representing real patients vessels segmented from CCTA clinical images."
