description: "Prisons present a unique environment for the spread of infectious diseases such as influenza, tuberculosis, and SARS-CoV-2: inmates have generally poorer health than average individuals of similar age; are generally confined in close proximity of each other, with regulated movements and interaction with staff often physical in nature; and their turnover constantly replenishes the susceptible population. Prisons are therefore highly vulnerable to new introductions, large outbreaks and significant disease burden. Although logistically difficult to manage, non-pharmaceutical interventions have been used during the COVID-19 pandemic. Inspired by this, I will present an analysis of an intervention that has not been used, namely asymptomatic testing and isolation very early on to interrupt an outbreak before it becomes large. Time permitting, I might also present a few slides on current work in progress on a model used to investigate the role of vaccination to limit the spread of gonorrhea and manage the emergence of anti-microbial resistance."
